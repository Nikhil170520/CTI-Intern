# CTI-Intern
## Internship Project: CTI Data Science Task Series
During my internship, I worked on a progressive series of data science tasks categorized into three levels — Level 1 (Beginner), Level 2 (Intermediate), and Level 3 (Advanced). Each task was executed in Jupyter Notebook and involved hands-on implementation of real-world data processing, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

🧩 Level 1: Fundamentals of Data Analysis
🔹 Task 1: Basic Data Analysis with Pandas
Explored a dataset using fundamental pandas operations. Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed basic statistical analysis to summarize key insights.

🔹 Task 2: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Visualized the dataset using various types of charts such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots. Gained insights into data distribution and relationships between features.

🔹 Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed a full EDA on the dataset, combining data cleaning, feature analysis, and rich visualizations. This laid the groundwork for future predictive modeling.

⚙️ Level 2: Intermediate Machine Learning and Modeling
🔸 Task 1: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
Implemented scaling, encoding, and feature selection techniques. Prepared datasets for model training by applying appropriate preprocessing pipelines.

🔸 Task 2: Classification Model Implementation
Built and evaluated classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Focused on model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

🔸 Task 3: Regression Analysis
Developed regression models (Linear and Multiple Regression) to predict continuous outcomes. Evaluated model performance using R² score and RMSE.
